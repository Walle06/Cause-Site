   <div id="text1"> So why should this matter to you? <br> Why should you take time out of an already busy schedule to lend thought to this? <br> Why do people still think its a hoax? <br> Doesnt the weather usually go through shifts? <br> Isn't it all part of the plan? <br> Haven't we already had a few ices ages? <br> Isn't this all just part of some "tree hugging" propaganda anyway?</div>

   <div id="text2"> Sadly, no. The question of wheather or not the Earths Climate is going through a drastic change is not really a topic for debate anymore. And yes it is true that Earths climate has historically gone through stages of dramatic and sometimes destructive shifts. Among the theories that exist it is belived that one of these shifts is what could have potentially brought on the mass extinction that took out the dinosaurs.</div>

   	 Taking all that into consideration still leaves us woefully short of hitting as they say the nail on the head. What people often miss is this, Every time that Earth previously experienced a shift in its climate it was a shift that happened hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years seperated from the previous one. It was a shift that occurred naturally and organically over the course of generations. This time however <b>IT IS MAN MADE</b>. We did this, and we managed to do it in a third of the time that it normally takes for these things to happen naturally. In the short time we have been in existence on this planet we have  managed to do what once took the forces of the universe 400,000 years to do on its own. we have wiped out a third of the species that existed on this planet and reduced our natural resources by HALF and counting. We have managed to start a chain of events that most Scientists beleive can not be stopped and will result in the melting of any and all natural ice formations on this planet. If none of this has managed to shake you then take a close look at the image of our planet directly above, the world as it is today, and click it to see what we will look like when all the ice is gone.
