   <div id="weatherText"> -Storms are getting bigger, traveling greater distances and lasting much longer. The seasons are becoming increasingly erratic with winter stretching into almost may at times and summer temperatures reaching record highs across the nation. Storms are getting stronger across the board leading us to create categories such as "superstorm" which is essentially a hurricane that is occurring out of season so calling it a hurricane just wouldnt make "sense" <br><br><br><br> - The beach pictured here didnt exist a mere decade ago, today this highway is no longer in use because the up tick in erosion has lead to the eating away of this coastline in only a matter of years. Now all the houses you see are in grave danger of collapsing at any moment the ground gives way. Just another side effect of rising choppier tides. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> - The increase of the average temperature of the planet has lead to stronger more devestating storms that are occurring in places that previously have never had to deal with weather of this magnitude and are therefore not prepared structurally to withstand a blow like that. Leading to billions of dollars in damage and rescue operations and millions of displaced individuals who are left destitute.</div>
