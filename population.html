	<div id="popText"> Something we have to come to terms with is this: THERE ARE TOO MANY OF US. The surface area of the land on Earth is 57 268 900 square miles which accounts for about 27% of the Earths total surface area. The most generous figures give the earth enough land mass to comfortably sustain around 4.5 Billion people. Anything over 5 Billion and what happens is called planetary inflation, which means Earths population would burn through its natural resources faster than the Earth can replenish them. So, the point I am trying to convey to you is that not only is our current population inflated, it is categorically UNSUSTAINABLE based on how the majority of society lives its lives. Our outlook is not awfully bright if we dont collectively find a way to seriously curb our use of Earths natural resources.
