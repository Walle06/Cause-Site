	<div id="mainDiv"> Its no secret that as our temperatures have gotten higher our Polar ice caps have gotten smaller. Maps have been rewritten to exclude entire sections of land or whole islands, that are no longer accesible due to the fact that they are now under water. There are entire cities off the coast of japan that are now several hundred feet under water and can only be accessed with the proper scuba gear. Even the most conservative figures when regarding the rise in sea levels have the waters rising a minimum of 6 meters over the next 50-100 years. That jeapordizes every single coastal community we have, most of which have large domestic populations and are large tourist attractions. Lower Manhattan alone would be severely compromised with a sea level rise of only 3 meters. 6 meters would see it become completely uninhabbitable. If you have ever been to Venice and spent an entire 24 hours there then you have a small window into what awaits every coastal lying city in the world. Although to be fair, the Venetians are in the process of implementing a revolutionary electronic dam system that would reduce their high tide floods by half. Still it is only a delay in what is inevitable. Venice is the sinking city, its part of the lure of the town. the world however can certainly not afford to have every coastal city become a worst case scenario version of venice.  </div>
