	<div id="Banner"> Climate Change </div>
	<div id="textDiv">Think about the last year, are you thinking? good. think about everytime you thought to yourself "man, groceries are taking more and more of my budget" OR "no seriously I know we say it every year but this summer is WAAAY hotter than last year!".OR "Honestly the traffic congestion gets so bad that I almost dont want to drive anymore. " <br> Well what if I told you that all these things can be tied back to the simple premise of <b>Climate Change</b>? Think I'm throwing you for a loop? think again, Climate Change is THE issue of our generation and is at the root of most if not all of our wordly problems. No matter how you look at it if you dig deep enough everything either leads back to or is caused by the ever increasing "body" temperature of the place we call Home. <br>The purpose of this webpage is to inform if not down right terrify you about the all too serious reality facing us as a species, and in turn hopefully guide you to making more informed choices in your everyday life.
